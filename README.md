# ESP32-Web-Based-Buzzer-Control-via-WiFi
This project demonstrates how to control a buzzer connected to an ESP32 using a simple web interface over Wi-Fi. Once connected to your local Wi-Fi network, the ESP32 runs a basic web server that allows users to turn the buzzer ON or OFF using buttons on a webpage.
